description: Share the local application with friends using Expose
---

To share your local application with friends for testing, you can use **Expose**, which is already installed on your system.

1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    expose share ugtr-backend.test
    ```
    *(Replace `ugtr-backend.test` with your actual local domain if it's different)*

3.  Expose will generate a public URL (e.g., `https://ugtr-backend.sharedwithexpose.com`) that you can send to your friends.
4.  Keep the terminal window open while they are testing. When you close it, the site will go offline.

**Note:** Since this runs on your computer, your computer must stay on and connected to the internet.
